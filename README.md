### Code Documentation: ###

#### `AppUI.py` ####
The `AppUI.py` file consists of all the GUI components visible to the user. This includes the starting frame, the main frame, and the graphs being displayed on screen.

The `AppUI.py` file also contains helper functions that pull the weather data from the API used, which is then assigned to specific values that are used for the main frame.

#### `canada_cities.py` ####
The `canada_cities.py` file takes all the cities of the world pulled from the API and filters them down to Ontario cities only.

The first loop goes through all cities and filters the cities down to Canada-only cities, then the second loop filters it down further to Ontario-only cities.

#### `city.list.json` ####
The `city.list.json` file contains all the cities across the world from the API, but in a json format (used for `canada_cities.py`).

#### `config.ini` ####
The `config.ini` file contains the API key. 

This is used in the API URL to collect real-time data for the current and 7-day forecast of the city you want.

#### `graph.py` ####
The `graph.py` file consists of all the graph functions that are used in `AppUI.py` in order to show the graphs of your choice.

This file consists of three functions: 
1. The data_frame function which is used to grab all the data from the API and turn it into a dataframe for plotting graphs
2. The chart_temp_overview function which is used to display the general temperature overview of the city of choice
3. The custom function which is used ot display the specific graph of the your choice

#### `history.pkl` ####
The `history.pkl` file contains the history of cities searched for on the application (stored in this file).

#### `main.py` ####
The `main.py` file is used to run the entire application.

#### `icons` ####
The `icons` folder contains all the icons used for both the starting frame and the main frame.

These icons can be found on the same website used for our API (link will be in code comments).
